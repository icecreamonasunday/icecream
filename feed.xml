    <content type="html">Everyone loves mint chip but how can we make it more interesting? Well nothing is made worse by the addition of delicious slightly undercooked brownies.



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 cups heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 cup whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup + 2 tbsp. sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;6 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1-2 brownies, small pieces&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1½ tsp. mint extract&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup dark chocolate, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combine the milk, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a medium saucepan and heat over low to medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once steam is coming off of the heated milk/cream in the saucepan, pour a splash into the egg mixture while whisking it continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Continue to add small amounts of the milk/cream to the eggs while whisking until you've added all of it into the separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and set over low to medium heat. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After stirring for several minutes the custard will start to thicken. Once you can pick up the spatula or spoon and the custard sticks to it, hold it horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If it leaves a trail that stays, your custard is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take it off the heat and strain the custard into the bowl set over the ice bath. Stir for about 5 minutes until the custard has cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Combine&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Place the custard in an airtight container and let the it cool completely in the fridge (this is important people!) for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once it's ready add the mint extract, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. About 5 minutes before the churning is done, add the dark chocolate and brownies to the mixture. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <content type="html">Had to switch it up and add some sweet caramel to the cookies &amp; cream because it can't be that basic. It's delicious.



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½-1 cup oreos&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Caramel of choice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;6 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 cups heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3/4 cups sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ tsp. salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Once it's ready, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. During the last 5 minutes of churning, add the cookiest and caramel into the mix until the caramel forms ribbons. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">I know this seems like a weird combo, and if you don't like rice pudding then that's sad but if you do! you will probably love this. The flavors are so smooth and lovely.



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 cup jasmine rice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1½ cups whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;8 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 cups heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3/4 cups sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 bay leaf&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp. nutmeg&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ tsp. ground cardamom&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ vanilla bean, seeds scraped out&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Rice Pudding&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Put rice in a saucepan and add enough water to cover it. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the rice softens. Drain any excess water.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add 1 cup of milk, ½ cup sugar, salt, the bay leaf, cardamom, nutmeg, and the vanilla bean seeds and pod.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bring to a simmer and then reduce heat and keep it uncovered until fully cooked and the milk has been mostly absorbed by the rice. You can refrigerate the rice pudding until it is ready to be used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combine the remaining 1/5 cup milk, heavy cream, and pinch of salt in a medium saucepan and heat over low to medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once steam is coming off of the heated milk/cream in the saucepan, pour a splash into the egg mixture while whisking it continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Continue to add small amounts of the milk/cream to the eggs while whisking until you've added all of it into the separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and set over low to medium heat. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After stirring for several minutes the custard will start to thicken. Once you can pick up the spatula or spoon and the custard sticks to it, hold it horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If it leaves a trail that stays, your custard is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take it off the heat and strain the custard into the bowl set over the ice bath. Stir for about 5 minutes until the custard has cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Combine&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once the custard has cooled, fold in the rice pudding until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Place the custard in an airtight container and let the it cool completely in the fridge (this is important people!) for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once it's ready, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">Roasted banana ice cream: the creamiest of cold creams ever.



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4 ripe bananas, sliced&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;4 tbsp. unsalted butter&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;pinch of salt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp. dark brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;6 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 cups heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;3/4 cups sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ tsp. salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Roasted Bananas&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 400F.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Toss the brown sugar, butter, and sliced bananas in a bowl until combined.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Spread them on a baking sheet and put in the oven until caramelized (about 15-20 min).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take them off the baking sheet and let cool (the melted sugar will make them stick to the pan). They don't have to look pretty because they'll be blended into the ice cream.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combine the milk, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a medium saucepan and heat over low to medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once steam is coming off of the heated milk/cream in the saucepan, pour a splash into the egg mixture while whisking it continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Continue to add small amounts of the milk/cream to the eggs while whisking until you've added all of it into the separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and set over low to medium heat. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After stirring for several minutes the custard will start to thicken. Once you can pick up the spatula or spoon and the custard sticks to it, hold it horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If it leaves a trail that stays, your custard is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take it off the heat and strain the custard into the bowl set over the ice bath. Stir for about 5 minutes until the custard has cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Combine&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once the custard has cooled, use an immersion blender (or regular blender if you don't have one) to combine the roasted bananas with the custard.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Place the custard in an airtight container and let the it cool completely in the fridge (this is important people!) for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once it's ready, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">Honestly this flavor was okay. Not my favorite. You might be thinking, why is it on this blog? Well, it's fun to make these illustrations and purple swirl looks pretty.



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup fresh blueberries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp. sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Drop of lemon juice&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1½ cups heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;2 tbsp. whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp. salt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;8 egg yolks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1½ cups sour cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Blueberry Compote&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combine the blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice and bring to a simmer over medium heat in a saucepan. Cook until the berries are soft and the juices thicken.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Set aside to cool for later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Combine the milk, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a medium saucepan and heat over low to medium heat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once steam is coming off of the heated milk/cream in the saucepan, pour a splash into the egg mixture while whisking it continuously.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Continue to add small amounts of the milk/cream to the eggs while whisking until you've added all of it into the separate bowl.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and set over low to medium heat. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After stirring for several minutes the custard will start to thicken. Once you can pick up the spatula or spoon and the custard sticks to it, hold it horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If it leaves a trail that stays, your custard is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Take it off the heat and strain the custard into the bowl set over the ice bath. Add the sour cream and use an immersion blender until it's all combined. Stir for about 5 minutes until the custard has cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Combine&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Place the custard in an airtight container and let the it cool completely in the fridge (this is important people!) for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once it's ready, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. Fold the blueberry compote in at the very end of churning or while you're transferring the ice cream to containers for the freezer. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html">What's better than oreos and peanut butter? Nothing! That's why I combined them into one of my favorite flavors (but let's be real, they're all my favorite).



&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Ingredients
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 ½ cup heavy cream&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 ½ cup whole milk&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;½ cup sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;¼ cup brown sugar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;¾ teaspoon xanthan gum&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 pinch salt&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;⅓ cup creamy peanut butter&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;1 cup Oreo, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 class="recipe-section-header"&gt;
    Directions
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Philadelphia Style Custard&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prep the sugar, brown sugar, salt and xantham gum by gently mixing them together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pour the milk in a pot, whisk in the sugar/xantham mixture.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add the corn syrup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Heat the milk mixture on low-medium heat stirring constantly until it thickens and the sugar is completely melted into the milk. Make sure not to let it boil because the milk will curdle. Start with a lower temperature and let it heat up slowly for more control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once thickened, whisk in the peanut butter until the mixture is homogenous.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once it's cooled down a little, add the heavy cream and stir to mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Let sit overnight in the fridge (or at least 4 hours). *Do not skip this step or it will not freeze properly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Add to your ice cream maker and freeze according to the machine's instructions. Add the chopped oreos when there is about 5 minutes left in the churning. Stop churning when it reaches the consistency of soft serve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You can eat it right away for softer ice cream or freeze it for several hours to have harder ice cream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content>
