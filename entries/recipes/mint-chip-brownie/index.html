<h3 class="recipe-section-header">
    Ingredients
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>½ cup + 2 tbsp. sugar</li>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>1-2 brownies, small pieces</li>
    <li>1½ tsp. mint extract</li>
    <li>½ cup dark chocolate, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="recipe-section-header">
    Directions
</h3>

<ol>
    <h4>Custard</h4>
    <li>Prepare a large bowl filled with ice water with a smaller bowl sitting in the water. This will be used to cool the cooked custard later.</li>
    <li>Combine the milk, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup white sugar in a medium saucepan and heat over low to medium heat.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, whisk together the egg yolks with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar in a separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Once steam is coming off of the heated milk/cream in the saucepan, pour a splash into the egg mixture while whisking it continuously.</li>
    <li>Continue to add small amounts of the milk/cream to the eggs while whisking until you've added all of it into the separate bowl.</li>
    <li>Pour the combined mixture back into the saucepan and set over low to medium heat. Stir continuously with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>After stirring for several minutes the custard will start to thicken. Once you can pick up the spatula or spoon and the custard sticks to it, hold it horizontally and run your finger through the custard. If it leaves a trail that stays, your custard is ready.</li>
    <li>Take it off the heat and strain the custard into the bowl set over the ice bath. Stir for about 5 minutes until the custard has cooled.</li>
    <br />
    <h4>Combine</h4>
    <li>Place the custard in an airtight container and let the it cool completely in the fridge (this is important people!) for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.</li>
    <li>Once it's ready add the mint extract, churn it according to your ice cream maker's instructions until it's the consistency of soft servce. About 5 minutes before the churning is done, add the dark chocolate and brownies to the mixture. You can eat it right away for a softer texture, or freeze it for later.</li>
